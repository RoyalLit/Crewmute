CONFIDENTIAL — INTERNAL USE ONLY
 
1. Executive Summary
Crewmute is a mobile-first carpool platform designed specifically for Indian college students who travel home on weekends and holidays. Students currently rely on fragmented WhatsApp groups and personal networks to find co-passengers for shared cabs — a process that is slow, unreliable, and limited to existing contacts.

Crewmute solves this by providing a structured, trusted platform where students can post rides or browse available seats, coordinate with verified co-passengers, and split cab costs transparently — all from a single mobile app.

Problem Statement
Every weekend, thousands of Indian college students travel home via shared cabs. Finding co-passengers today means posting in WhatsApp groups, waiting for responses, coordinating manually, and hoping the timing aligns. There is no dedicated product for this specific use case — intercity student travel to home cities on weekends and holidays.

Solution
A React Native mobile app (Android + iOS) with a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend, enabling students to post rides, browse matches by route and date, request seats, coordinate via in-app chat, and split costs transparently.

Target Users
•	Indian college students aged 18–24
•	Traveling intercity to home cities on weekends and public holidays
•	Using shared cabs (not personal vehicles) as the primary mode
•	Seeking to reduce cost and find trusted co-passengers

8. Non-Functional Requirements
8.1 Performance
•	API response time: < 300ms for 95th percentile under normal load
•	App cold start: < 3 seconds on mid-range Android device
•	Real-time message delivery: < 500ms latency
•	Tab bar BlurView must not be rendered on Android — gated with Platform.OS === 'ios'. Android solid fallback must not cause jank on Snapdragon 680-class devices (target: 0 dropped frames during tab switch).

8.2 Security
•	All passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
•	JWT access tokens expire in 15 minutes
•	Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies on web; secure storage on mobile
•	All API routes protected with auth middleware except register/login
•	Input validation on all endpoints using express-validator
•	Rate limiting on auth endpoints (express-rate-limit)

8.3 Reliability
•	Zero-downtime deployments via Railway
•	MongoDB Atlas automatic backups (free tier: daily)
•	Error logging via console.error → upgrade to Sentry post-MVP

8.4 Compatibility
•	Android: 8.0+ (API 26+)
•	iOS: 14.0+
•	Screen sizes: 5" – 6.7" phones, portrait mode primary
•	Liquid Glass blur tab bar requires iOS 15+ (BlurView systemChromeMaterial tint). On iOS 14 — which is in scope — fall back to the Android solid style. Gate with Platform.Version.

9. Build Timeline
Total: 6 weeks at 20+ hours/week.

Week	Phase	Deliverables
1	Backend Core	Project setup, Express boilerplate, MongoDB connection, Auth endpoints (register, login, OTP, refresh, logout), JWT middleware, Postman collection
2	Backend Features	Ride CRUD endpoints, Request endpoints, User profile endpoints, Cloudinary integration, Input validation, Rate limiting, GitHub Actions CI
3	Mobile Foundation	Expo project setup, Expo Router navigation, NativeWind config, Auth screens (register, login, OTP), Profile setup screen, API integration (Axios)
4	Mobile Core	Home feed, Ride detail, Post ride form, Request flow, My rides screen, Google Places autocomplete, Cost calculator UI
5	Real-time & Polish	Socket.io chat, Push notifications (Expo), Read receipts, Error states, Loading skeletons, Edge case handling
6	Ship	EAS build (APK + IPA), Railway backend deploy, MongoDB Atlas production setup, README, demo video, GitHub cleanup

 
10. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Likelihood	Mitigation
React Native learning curve delays mobile build	High	Start with Expo, use NativeWind for familiar syntax, mock API in Week 3
Google Maps API billing	Medium	Use Places autocomplete only (low call volume), set billing alert at $0
College email not available for all Indian students	High	Student ID fallback implemented as P0
Socket.io complexity on mobile	Medium	Use Expo managed workflow, test on real device from day one
Railway free tier cold starts	Low	Add keep-alive ping via cron job or UptimeRobot (free)
BlurView performance on Android mid-range devices.	Medium	BlurView is iOS-only in implementation. Android uses a solid semi-opaque fallback. No BlurView code path executes on Android.

11. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
v1.1
•	Ratings and reviews for riders
•	Ride history with basic stats
•	Gender preference filter (opt-in)

v1.2
•	In-app UPI payment via Razorpay
•	Verified college badge system
•	Group chat for rides with 3+ passengers

v2.0
•	Live ride tracking via Google Maps
•	Emergency contact sharing feature
•	Admin dashboard for moderation
•	iOS App Store + Google Play Store submission

12. Competitive Landscape
App	Target	Model	Gap Crewmute Fills
BlaBlaCar	General public	Driver-owned cars	No student-specific trust model, not built for shared cabs
QuickRide	Office commuters	Daily carpool	Not designed for intercity weekend/holiday travel
sRide	Professionals	Office carpools	Corporate-focused, not student-centric
WhatsApp Groups	Everyone	Manual coordination	No structure, no verification, no seat management

Crewmute's differentiation: the only platform built specifically for Indian college students doing intercity travel home on weekends and holidays, with college-based identity verification and shared cab coordination as core features.
